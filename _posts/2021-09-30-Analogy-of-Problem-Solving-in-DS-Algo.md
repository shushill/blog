If you are struggling in solving algorithm problems, then the following analogy might help you !!

Do you know why restaurants are able to cook food quicker than us making at home?
It's because they have most of the ingradients ready and are just putting them together to give you a warm/freshly cooked dish.
Sometimes the whole thing is cooked already and they are just microwaving it for you. 

We cant memorize 1000's of leetcode questions. However we can memorize the patterns that are common in those problems.
When I'm able to solve a problem quickly, its because I can recognize what kind of problems it is e.g., two pointer approach, BFS/DFS, sliding window, etc.
Also for each pattern, there are some common parts to the solution that we can memorize as well so we can quickly code it up.
45 mins are not enough to invent something new. We are just putting things like just cooks in a restaurant. Most of the time what is changing is just conditions and special cases.
Our pattern recognition improves when we harvest the thought process of others. That can be done by mock interviews. Do lots of them and look for patterns.
